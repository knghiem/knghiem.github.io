      <description>I turned 25.
It feels unreal that I had past the middle mark of my 20s. My 25th birthday went by like any other day. I clocked into work at 8:30 in the morning, raced against the deadline to package a new version of my team’s software, had lunch and coffee by myself at the office, did the same work for a few more hours before clocking out at 5:30.</description>

      <description>Lately, I have been obsessed with Janelle Monáe. This obsession began with her latest album “Dirty Computer”. I admire how articulate and thoughtful she is with everything that she does. So I did what any true fan would do: I tried to watch as many interviews with Janelle Monáe as possible.</description>
