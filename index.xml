      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a technologist, programmer, and writer based in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m co-writing a novel and preparing for graduate school applications in Information Studies. I want to work in digital humanities, helping people access, navigate, and study cultural heritage from reliable sources.
I moved to the US at 17 to attend Connecticut College (go Camels!) and was a visiting student at Columbia University for a semester. I lived in Austin, Texas for 3 years while working at Google Cloud in various positions.</description>
