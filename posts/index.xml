      <description>It’s good to know when to give up. I guess this is my announcement that I’m giving up on this monthly reflection project. I was still stuck on writing my October post.</description>

      <description>I turned 25.
It feels unreal that I had past the middle mark of my 20s. My 25th birthday went by like any other day. I clocked into work at 8:30 in the morning, raced against the deadline to package a new version of my team’s software, had lunch and coffee by myself at the office, did the same work for a few more hours before clocking out at 5:30.</description>

      <description>I made a commitment to write a reflection post every month to capture the highlights of my journey back home in Vietnam. I decided to unpublish my first post to rewrite it and republish at a later time.</description>

      <description>Genres: Art pop, electronic
In our current time, I can’t think of any artist as multi-talented as FKA twigs. Since her critically acclaimed LP1 that reset the bar for experimental R&amp;amp;B, accompanied by avant-garde music videos with breath-taking art direction and masterful choreography (all done with twigs at the helm), she never stopped extending the limits of her talents.</description>

      <description>Lately, I have been obsessed with Janelle Monáe. This obsession began with her latest album “Dirty Computer”. I admire how articulate and thoughtful she is with everything that she does. So I did what any true fan would do: I tried to watch as many interviews with Janelle Monáe as possible.</description>
